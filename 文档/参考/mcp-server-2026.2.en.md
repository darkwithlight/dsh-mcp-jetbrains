# MCP Server

> For the complete documentation index, see [llms.txt](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2026.2/llms.txt).

Starting with version 2025.2,  IntelliJ IDEA comes with an integrated [MCP Server](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/26071-mcp-server), allowing external clients such as Claude Code, Codex, VS Code, and others to access tools provided by the IDE. This gives users the ability to control and interact with JetBrains IDEs without leaving their application of choice.

> **Tip:**
> You can find more information about the Model Context Protocol (MCP) [here](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction).

Procedure: Enable the MCP Server plugin

This functionality relies on the  MCP Server plugin, which  is bundled and enabled in IntelliJ IDEA   by default. If the relevant features are not available, make sure that you did not disable the plugin.

1. Press `Ctrl+Alt+S` (Windows), `⌘ Comma` (macOS), `⌘ Comma` (IntelliJ IDEA Classic (macOS)), `⌘ Comma` (macOS System Shortcuts), `Ctrl+Alt+S` (XWin), `Ctrl+Alt+S` (GNOME), `Ctrl+Alt+S` (KDE), `Ctrl+Alt+S` (Emacs), `Ctrl+Alt+S` (Sublime Text), `⌘ Comma` (Sublime Text (macOS)), `Ctrl+Alt+S` (NetBeans), `Ctrl+Alt+S` (Visual Studio), `⌘ Comma` (Visual Studio (macOS)), `Ctrl+Alt+S` (Eclipse), `⌘ Comma` (Eclipse (macOS)) to open settings and then select `Plugins`.

2. Open the Installed tab, find the MCP Server plugin, and select the checkbox next to the plugin name.

## Enable MCP Server

To enable the MCP server, do the following:

Procedure:

1. Go to `Settings | Tools | MCP Server`.

2. Select the Enable MCP Server checkbox.

![Select the Enable MCP Server checkbox](https://resources.jetbrains.com/help/img/idea/2026.2/aia_enabling_mcp_server.png)

3. In the Enable MCP Server? dialog, review what access third-party applications will get to the projects opened in the IDE, and click Enable to continue.

4. Click Apply.

Once the MCP server is enabled, you can proceed to configure external clients.

## External client setup

For detected external clients like Junie, VS Code, Claude Code, Codex, Air, and GitHub Copilot CLI, configuration can be performed automatically. Setting up a client means adding the address of the IDE MCP server to that client's configuration file.

To do this:

Procedure:

1. Go to `Settings | Tools | MCP Server`.

2. In the Clients Auto-Configuration section, click Auto-Configure for each client you want to set up for use with the MCP server. This updates the client's configuration file automatically. The set of configured transports depends on the client.

![MCP Server settings](https://resources.jetbrains.com/help/img/idea/2026.2/ai_mcp_server_settings.png)

To configure a specific transport yourself, click ![](https://resources.jetbrains.com/help/img/idea/2026.2/app-client.expui.general.chevronDownLarge.svg) next to Auto-Configure and select the required option from the list.

![Configuration options](https://resources.jetbrains.com/help/img/idea/2026.2/ai_mcp_server_config_options.png)

> **Tip:**
> The same menu provides two more options:
>
>
>
> * Open Client Settings File opens the client's configuration file in the editor.
>
> * Copy Config copies the configuration to the clipboard so that you can apply it manually.

3. Restart your client for the configuration to take effect.

## Project-level client setup

Some clients also read a configuration file from the project's working directory. For these clients, the IDE can write the connection settings directly to the configuration file in the currently opened project, so the MCP server is available only while you work on that project.

Use this option if you work with several projects and do not want the MCP server registered for every client session.

Procedure:

1. Go to `Settings | Tools | MCP Server`.

2. In the Project Clients Auto-Configuration section, click Auto-Configure for each client you want to set up. This updates the client's project-level configuration file automatically.

![Autoconfigure client's project-level configuration](https://resources.jetbrains.com/help/img/idea/2026.2/ai_mcp_server_project_level_setup.png)

If you want to configure a specific transport mechanism, click ![](https://resources.jetbrains.com/help/img/idea/2026.2/app-client.expui.general.chevronDownLarge.svg) next to Auto-Configure and select the required option from the list.

3. Restart your client for the configuration to take effect.

## Manual client setup

If the client you want to connect is not on the list, configure it manually.

Procedure:

1. In the Manual Client Configuration section, click either Copy SSE Config, Copy Stdio Config, or Copy HTTP Stream Config depending on the connection type.

![MCP Server manual configuration](https://resources.jetbrains.com/help/img/idea/2026.2/ai_mcp_server_manual_config.png)

2. Paste the copied configuration into your client's settings or configuration file.

3. Restart your client for the configuration to take effect.

## Execute actions without confirmation

The MCP server allows connected external clients to execute terminal commands or run configurations in the IDE without prompting for user confirmation each time.

To enable this mode:

Procedure:

1. Go to `Settings | Tools | MCP Server`.

2. In the Command execution section, enable the Run shell commands or run configurations without confirmation (brave mode) setting.

3. Click Apply.

## Show setup suggestions in terminal sessions

When Codex or Claude starts in a terminal session without a matching MCP server setup, the IDE can show a banner that suggests configuring the connection.

![A suggestion to update the MCP Server configuration in terminal](https://resources.jetbrains.com/help/img/idea/2026.2/ai_mcp_server_terminal_suggestions.png)

To control this behavior:

Procedure:

1. Go to `Settings | Tools | MCP Server`.

2. In the Terminal Sessions section, select or clear the Show setup suggestions for Codex and Claude terminal sessions checkbox.

3. Click Apply.

## Supported tools

The MCP Server exposes a set of tools that allow external clients to interact with your IDE and project – for example, to analyze code, modify files, run configurations, or execute terminal commands.

You can view and manage the full list of available tools in `Settings | Tools | MCP Server | Exposed Tools`. For each tool, select or clear the Enabled checkbox to control whether the tool is exposed to external clients.

![The Exposed Tools settings page](https://resources.jetbrains.com/help/img/idea/2026.2/ai_mcp_server_exposed_tools.png)

You can also select the Router-only checkbox for a tool. Router-only tools are hidden from the direct MCP tool list and remain available only through the dedicated router [tool](#universal-toolset). This keeps unnecessary tool descriptions out of the tool list and saves context. Use the Enable router-only mode for setting to specify when router-only mode applies, for example, for All agents, or ACP agents only.

> **Tip:**
> When a tool is available only through the router, describe it in skills or other agent documentation so that agents know when to use it.

Below you can find the list of tools provided by the MCP server.

### Analysis tools

analyze_calls
: Builds the IDE Call Hierarchy tree for a method, function, constructor, or supported type target. Use it to see who calls a symbol (`INCOMING_CALLS`) or what the symbol calls (`OUTGOING_CALLS`).
:
:
:
: Prefer this tool over usage search, text search, or regex search when evaluating dependencies by actual calls. It uses IDE call hierarchy data, so it provides more precise call relationships with less noise and fewer follow-up calls than primitive searches.
:
:
:
: Pass `symbolFqn` as a fully qualified name, for example `com.example.Service.run`. If the name is ambiguous, the tool returns exact signatures; pass one of them back as `symbolFqn`. If you only know a short name or fragment, use `search_symbol` first to find the target.
:
:
:
: The result is an expandable text tree. Each node includes `filePath` and `treePath`; `filePath` is project-relative when possible. Pass `treePath` back to render the subtree. Use `childOffset` to continue after a truncated … and n more line. `depth`, `maxChildren`, and `maxNodes` bound the rendered tree. Symbols can come from project sources, source jars, or decompiled binary jar dependencies when the IDE can resolve them.
:
:
:
: Parameters:
:
:
:
: * `symbolFqn` (required): Plain fully qualified symbol name, or an exact signature returned by an ambiguity error or copied from a rendered child node. If you only know a short name or fragment, use `search_symbol` first and pass the best fully qualified callable name here. Examples: `com.example.Service.run`, `com.example.Service.run(String)`, or `org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat(String)`. Do not pass a file path, line, column, or a separate target signature.
:
: * `analysisKind` (required): Call analysis direction. Use `INCOMING_CALLS` to show callers of `symbolFqn`, or `OUTGOING_CALLS` to show symbols called from `symbolFqn`.
:
: * `depth`: Maximum number of call levels to render below the requested subtree root. Defaults to 5. Use 0 to render only the subtree root.
:
: * `maxChildren`: Maximum number of direct children rendered for each node. Defaults to 50.
:
: * `maxNodes`: Maximum total number of rendered call nodes. Defaults to 1000.
:
: * `treePath`: Optional path to a subtree root, copied exactly from a previous `analyze_calls` result. Null or omitted means the root path `[]`. Each component is an exact signature, not a display name.
:
: * `childOffset`: Offset for paging direct children of the node addressed by `treePath`. Defaults to 0.
:
: * `timeout`: Timeout in milliseconds.
:
: * `projectPath`: The project path. Always provide this value if known to reduce ambiguous calls. If only the current working directory is known, you can use it as the project path.

build_project
: Triggers building of the project or specified files, waits for completion, and returns build errors. Use this tool to build the project or compile files and get detailed information about compilation errors and warnings.
:
:
:
: You have to use this tool after performing edits to validate if the edits are valid.
:
:
:
: Parameters:
:
:
:
: * `rebuild`: Whether to perform a full rebuild of the project. Defaults to false. Effective only when `filesToRebuild` is not specified.
:
: * `filesToRebuild`: If specified, only compile files with the specified paths. Paths are relative to the project root.
:
: * `timeout`: Timeout in milliseconds.
:
: * `projectPath`: The project path. Always provide this value if known to reduce ambiguous calls. If only the current working directory is known, you can use it as the project path.

get_file_problems
: Analyzes the specified file for errors and warnings using IntelliJ inspections. Use this tool to identify coding issues, syntax errors, and other problems in a specific file.
:
:
:
: Returns a list of problems, including severity, description, and location information.
:
:
:
: > **Note: Notes**
: > * Only files within the project directory can be analyzed.
: >
: > * Line and column numbers are 1-based.
:
:
:
: Parameters:
:
:
:
: * `filePath`: Path relative to the project root.
:
: * `errorsOnly`: Whether to include only errors or both errors and warnings.
:
: * `timeout`: Timeout in milliseconds.
:
: * `projectPath`: The project path. Always provide this value if known to reduce ambiguous calls. If only the current working directory is known, you can use it as the project path.

get_project_dependencies
: Returns a list of all dependencies defined in the project. Provides structured information about library names.
:
:
:
: Parameters:
:
:
:
: * `projectPath`: The project path. Always provide this value if known to reduce ambiguous calls. If only the current working directory is known, you can use it as the project path.

get_project_modules
: Returns a list of all modules in the project with their types. Provides structured information about each module, including its name and type.
:
:
:
: Parameters:
:
:
:
: * `projectPath`: The project path. Always provide this value if known to reduce ambiguous calls. If only the current working directory is known, you can use it as the project path.

lint_files
: Analyzes the specified files for errors and warnings using IntelliJ inspections. Use this tool to lint several files after editing them. Returns per-file problems with severity, description, and location information.
:
:
:
: Batch responses may include file entries with `timedOut: true` and empty `problems` when individual files exceed the available budget. File entries with a `notAnalyzedReason` indicate files that could not be analyzed, for example files outside project content roots, excluded files, or unsupported file types. A top-level `more: true` means the batch is incomplete.
:
:
:
: > **Note: Notes**
: > * Only files within the project directory are analyzed.
: >
: > * Line and column numbers are 1-based.
:
:
:
: Parameters:
:
:
:
: * `files` (required): List of project-relative files to analyze. Duplicate paths are ignored after normalization.
:
: * `min_severity`: Minimum severity to include: `warning` or `error`. Defaults to `warning`.

: * `timeout`: Timeout in milliseconds.
:
: * `projectPath`: The project path. Always provide this value if known to reduce ambiguous calls. If only the current working directory is known, you can use it as the project path.

### Code Insight tools

get_symbol_info
: Retrieves information about the symbol at the specified position in the specified file. Provides the same information as IntelliJ IDEA's Quick Documentation feature. The information may include the symbol's name, signature, type, documentation, and other details, depending on the programming language.
:
:
:
: If the position references a symbol, the tool will return a code snippet with the symbol's declaration, if available. Use this tool to understand a symbol's declaration, semantics, and location.
:
:

:
:
:
: * `filePath`: Path relative to the project root.
:
: * `line`: 1-based line number.
:
: * `column`: 1-based column number.
:
: * `projectPath`: The project path. Always provide this value if known to reduce ambiguous calls. If only the current working directory is known, you can use it as the project path.

### Database-specific tools

> **Note:**
> This functionality relies on the [Database Tools and SQL](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10925-database-tools-and-sql-for-webstorm--rustrover)  plugin, which   you need to install and enable.   For more information, refer to [Open plugin settings](managing-plugins.html#open-plugin-settings).

To guarantee strictly read-only access for an AI agent, use a database user with properly restricted (read-only) privileges and configure the data source to use that user.

cancel_sql_query
: Cancel a running query using its unique ID.
:
:
:
: Parameters:
:
:
:
: * `sessionId`: Query session ID.

create_database_connection
: Creates a new database connection (data source) by name, DBMS (`dbms`), JDBC URL (`url`), and a flag to check the connection (`needToCheckDs`). All parameters are required. Returns connection diagnostic information.

:
: * `needToCheckDs`: Whether to test the connection right after the data source is created or edited. Set to `false` when configuring multiple connections in a batch — the per-connection probe is expensive, and `test_database_connection` can be called explicitly for the connections that matter.
:
: * `projectPath`: The project path. Always provide this value if known to reduce ambiguous calls. If only the current working directory is known, you can use it as the project path.

edit_database_connection
: Edits an existing database connection (data source) identified by `connectionId`. Updates the connection's DBMS driver and JDBC URL; the connection `name` is preserved. Returns connection diagnostic information.
:
:
:
: > **Note:**

### Debugger tools

> **Note:**
> These tools are provided by the Debugger MCP toolset plugin. This plugin comes bundled in IntelliJ IDEA by default. If the toolset is not available, make sure the plugin is enabled.

These tools give an external client control over the IDE's debugger: it can set, list, and remove breakpoints, start a debug session and step through it, and inspect the call stack, threads, and variable values at runtime.

> **Tip:**
> For detailed instructions on how to set up and use this toolset, refer to [Agentic debugging](agentic-debugging.html).

xdebug_control_session
: Controls the execution of a debug session. Use this tool to step through code, resume execution, pause, or stop the debug session.
:
:
:
: Preconditions:
:
:
:
: * A debug session must exist.
:
: * `STEP_*` and `RESUME` require a suspended session.
:
:
:
: Actions:
:
:
:
: * STEP_INTO: Step into the next method call
:
: * STEP_OVER: Step over the current line
:
: * STEP_OUT: Step out of the current method
:
: * RESUME: Resume program execution until the next breakpoint
:
: * PAUSE: Pause program execution
:
: * STOP: Stop the debug session
:
: * WAIT_FOR_PAUSE: Wait until the session pauses (breakpoint hit or paused manually)
:
: * DRAIN_EVENTS: Drain tracepoint outputs for the session (breakpoint errors are drained for all actions)
:
:
:
: Important notes:
:
:
:
: * If the program is running, use WAIT_FOR_PAUSE or PAUSE before `STEP_*` / `RESUME`.
:
: * Use a current `sessionId` from `[xdebug_get_debugger_status](#xdebug_get_debugger_status)` or `[xdebug_start_debugger_session](#xdebug_start_debugger_session)`. If a session stops, times out, or disappears, refresh the session list before the next session-scoped call.
:
: * RESUME does NOT set breakpoints. If there are no enabled breakpoints (or none will be hit next), the program may run to completion and the session may stop without pausing.
:
: * After RESUME, call WAIT_FOR_PAUSE to confirm the next suspension. If WAIT_FOR_PAUSE times out, consider PAUSE and re-check breakpoints.
:
: * DRAIN_EVENTS also requires an existing session; do not reuse a stale `sessionId` after the session has terminated.
:
:
:
: Next call:
:
:
:
: * After RESUME, call `xdebug_control_session(action=WAIT_FOR_PAUSE)`.
:
: * After a paused result, call `[xdebug_get_stack](#xdebug_get_stack)` / `[xdebug_get_frame_values](#xdebug_get_frame_values)` / `[xdebug_evaluate_expression](#xdebug_evaluate_expression)`.
:
:
:
: Status values in the result:
:
:
:
: * running: Program is executing
:
: * paused: Execution is suspended (breakpoint, step, or manual pause); paused results also include `frameValues`, a current-frame snapshot in `xdebug_get_frame_values(depth=0)` format when available
:
: * stopped: Debug session has terminated
:
: * `breakpointErrorsTail` is returned for any action
:
: * `tracepointOutputsTail` is returned only for DRAIN_EVENTS
:
:
:
: Event support scope:
:
:
:
: * Breakpoint error and tracepoint output events are currently reported only by JVM-based debuggers (Java, Kotlin, etc.).
:
: * On other debugger backends these event tails can be empty even when breakpoints/logging are configured.
:
:
:
: Parameters:
:
:
:
: * `sessionId`: Debug session ID. Use the current ID returned by `[xdebug_get_debugger_status](#xdebug_get_debugger_status)` or `[xdebug_start_debugger_session](#xdebug_start_debugger_session)`. If a session has stopped, timed out, or disappeared, refresh the session list before reusing an old ID. Format: uses session name as ID by default; if multiple sessions share the same name, ID is `<sessionName>#<executionId>`. If null and exactly one active session exists, it is selected automatically. If multiple sessions are active and `sessionId` is omitted, the call fails. Default: null.
:
: * `action`: Action to perform: STEP_INTO, STEP_OVER, STEP_OUT, RESUME, PAUSE, STOP, WAIT_FOR_PAUSE, DRAIN_EVENTS. Event draining is currently populated only by JVM-based debuggers (Java, Kotlin, etc.).
:
: * `timeout`: Timeout in milliseconds to wait for action completion. Guidance: STEP_* / PAUSE usually 5000-15000; WAIT_FOR_PAUSE usually 30000-120000 depending on workload and breakpoints. Default: 30000.
:
: * `eventsLimit`: Maximum number of latest events to drain per event list. For DRAIN_EVENTS this limit is applied independently to `breakpointErrorsTail` and `tracepointOutputsTail`. Default: 100.
:
: * `clearEventsAfterRead`: Compatibility flag. Returned events are always removed from internal buffers, regardless of this value.
:
: * `projectPath`: The project path. Always provide this value if known to reduce ambiguous calls. If only the current working directory is known, you can use it as the project path.

xdebug_evaluate_expression
: Evaluates an expression in the context of the current stack frame. Use this tool to compute values, call methods, or inspect expressions during debugging.
:
:
:
: Preconditions:
:
:
:
: * Session must be suspended.
:
: * Evaluation must be supported for the selected frame/language.
:
: * `expression` must be a valid expression in the language of the current frame.
:
:
:
: The result is returned as:
:
:
:
: * `depth == 0`: just the presentation of the evaluated expression
:
: * `depth > 0`: the presentation plus a pseudo-graphics tree of its children up to the requested depth
:
:
:
: Input rules:
:
:
:
: * Pass raw expression text exactly as the debugger evaluator should parse it.
:
: * Do not pass JSON-escaped payloads or literal escape sequences such as `\\"text\\"`.
:
:
:
: Next call:
:
:
:
: * If the expression confirms hypothesis, continue with `xdebug_control_session(STEP_*|RESUME)`.
:
: * If more detail is needed, inspect related values via `[xdebug_get_frame_values](#xdebug_get_frame_values)` / `[xdebug_get_value_by_path](#xdebug_get_value_by_path)`.
:
:
:
: Parameters:
:
:
:
: * `sessionId`: Debug session ID. Use the current ID returned by `[xdebug_get_debugger_status](#xdebug_get_debugger_status)` or `[xdebug_start_debugger_session](#xdebug_start_debugger_session)`.

Format: uses session name as ID by default; if multiple sessions share the same name, ID is `<sessionName>#<executionId>`. If null and exactly one active session exists, it is selected automatically. If multiple sessions are active and `sessionId` is omitted, the call fails. Default: null.
:
: * `frameIndex`: Stack frame index as integer (0 = top frame). Obtain this from the current paused `[xdebug_get_stack](#xdebug_get_stack)` result; do not reuse a cached frame index after RESUME, STEP_*, `xdebug_run_to_line`, or any change in paused location. If null, uses the top frame. Default: null.

:
: Preconditions:
:
:
:
: * Session must be suspended.
:
: * Path must be non-empty and refer to names visible in the selected frame/object.
:
:
:
: The result is returned as:
:
:

:
: * `depth > 0`: the presentation of the value plus a pseudo-graphics tree of its children up to the requested depth
:
:
:
: Example:
:
:
:
: * To get the value of `obj.field.subField`, use `path = ["obj", "field", "subField"]`.
:
: * For array/list indexers, pass the index token as a regular path element (child name), e.g. `items[0].name` -> `path = ["items", "[0]", "name"]`.
:
: * Use exact child names from the current paused `[xdebug_get_frame_values](#xdebug_get_frame_values)` / previous `[xdebug_get_value_by_path](#xdebug_get_value_by_path)` output because index node names may differ by language/debugger (for example, `"[0]"` vs `"0"`).
:
: * Refresh `path` tokens after RESUME, STEP_*, `xdebug_run_to_line`, or any other change in paused location.
:
:
:
: Next call:
:
:
:
: * Use another `[xdebug_get_value_by_path](#xdebug_get_value_by_path)` call to continue drilling deeper.
:
: * Use `[xdebug_evaluate_expression](#xdebug_evaluate_expression)` when direct name-path navigation is insufficient.

: * `sessionId`: Debug session ID. Use the current ID returned by `[xdebug_get_debugger_status](#xdebug_get_debugger_status)` or `[xdebug_start_debugger_session](#xdebug_start_debugger_session)`. If a session has stopped, timed out, or disappeared, refresh the session list before reusing an old ID. Format: uses session name as ID by default; if multiple sessions share the same name, ID is `<sessionName>#<executionId>`. If null and exactly one active session exists, it is selected automatically. If multiple sessions are active and `sessionId` is omitted, the call fails. Default: null.
:
: * `frameIndex`: Stack frame index as integer (0 = top frame). Obtain this from the current paused `[xdebug_get_stack](#xdebug_get_stack)` result; do not reuse a cached frame index after RESUME, STEP_*, `xdebug_run_to_line`, or any change in paused location. If null, uses the top frame. Default: null.
:
: * `path`: List of child names to navigate through, e.g. `['myObject', 'field', 'subField']` or `['items', '[0]', 'name']`. Use exact node names from the current paused `[xdebug_get_frame_values](#xdebug_get_frame_values)` / `[xdebug_get_value_by_path](#xdebug_get_value_by_path)` output and refresh stale path tokens after the paused location changes.
:
: * `depth`: Maximum depth for expanding children of the evaluated result (0 = value only, 1 = immediate children, 2 = children + grandchildren, etc.). Default: 0.
:
: * `projectPath`: The project path. Always provide this value if known to reduce ambiguous calls. If only the current working directory is known, you can use it as the project path.

xdebug_list_breakpoints
: Lists all breakpoints in the project or in a specific file. Use this tool to see all currently set breakpoints and their properties.
:
:
:
: > **Tip:**
: > Call this before RESUME to confirm there is at least one enabled breakpoint that is expected to be hit next.
:
:
:
: Behavior:
:
:
:
: * If `filePath` is provided, returns only breakpoints in that file.
:
: * Returns rich attributes for each breakpoint (`id`, `type`, `file`, `line`, `enabled`, `owner`, `condition`, `isLogMessage`, `isLogStack`, `temporary`, `suspendPolicy`, `hitCount`).
:
:
:
: Next call:
:
:
:
: * If no suitable breakpoint exists, call `[xdebug_set_breakpoint](#xdebug_set_breakpoint)`.
:
: * Then continue execution with `xdebug_control_session(action=RESUME)` and `xdebug_control_session(action=WAIT_FOR_PAUSE)`.
:
:
:
: Parameters:
:
:
:
: * `filePath`: Optional file path to filter breakpoints. Path to the file. Supports project-relative paths, paths with `..`, absolute paths, archive entries like `/path/lib.jar!/pkg/Foo.class`, and URLs such as `file://`, `jar://`, and `jrt://`. Any path returned from the other tools can be passed as is (e.g. paths from `search_*` tools). If not specified, returns all breakpoints. Default: null.
:
: * `projectPath`: The project path. Always provide this value if known to reduce ambiguous calls. If only the current working directory is known, you can use it as the project path.

xdebug_remove_breakpoint
: Removes breakpoints filtered by owner and optional selectors. Use this tool to remove previously set breakpoints.
:
:
:
: Behavior:
:
:
:
: * `owner` defaults to `agent`.
:
: * If only `owner` is provided, removes all breakpoints of that owner.
:
: * If `breakpointId` is provided, removes matching breakpoint(s) for the selected owner.
:
: * If `filePath`+`line` are provided, removes matching line breakpoint(s) for the selected owner.
:
: * If multiple selectors are provided, all of them are combined (logical AND).
:
: * Idempotent: removing a non-existing breakpoint returns `removed=false`.
:
: * To remove all breakpoints regardless of owner, call twice: once with `owner=user`, once with `owner=agent`.
:
:
:
: Next call:
:
:
:
: * Use `[xdebug_list_breakpoints](#xdebug_list_breakpoints)` to verify the remaining set.
:
:
:
: Parameters:

Any path returned from the other tools can be passed as is (e.g. paths from `search_*` tools). If not specified, returns all breakpoints. Default: null.
:
: * `line`: Optional input: line number (1-based) of the breakpoint to remove.
:
: * `owner`: Breakpoint owner filter. Default: agent.

xdebug_run_to_line
: Resumes execution to a target line. Use this tool to run until a specific source position without manually stepping.
:
:
:
: Preconditions:
:
:
:
: * Session must be suspended.
:
: * Target file/line must be valid.
:
:
:
: Outcome:
:
:
:
: * `paused`: session paused at or after target.
:
: * `stopped`: session terminated before pause.
:
: * `timeout`: no pause/stop within timeout window.
:
:
:
: Next call:
:
:
:
: * If paused, call `[xdebug_get_stack](#xdebug_get_stack)` / `[xdebug_get_frame_values](#xdebug_get_frame_values)` / `[xdebug_evaluate_expression](#xdebug_evaluate_expression)`.
:
: * If the session stopped or disappeared, refresh `sessionId` via `[xdebug_get_debugger_status](#xdebug_get_debugger_status)` before issuing another session-scoped call.
:
:
:
: Parameters:
:
:
:
: * `sessionId`: Debug session ID. Use the current ID returned by `[xdebug_get_debugger_status](#xdebug_get_debugger_status)` or `[xdebug_start_debugger_session](#xdebug_start_debugger_session)`. If a session has stopped, timed out, or disappeared, refresh the session list before reusing an old ID. Format: uses session name as ID by default; if multiple sessions share the same name, ID is `<sessionName>#<executionId>`. If null and exactly one active session exists, it is selected automatically. If multiple sessions are active and `sessionId` is omitted, the call fails. Default: null.
:
: * `filePath`: Path relative to the project root.
:
: * `line`: Target line number (1-based).
:
: * `timeout`: Timeout in milliseconds waiting for a paused/stopped result. Default: 30000.

xdebug_set_breakpoint
: Creates or updates a breakpoint. Use this tool to set line breakpoints, update existing breakpoints by ID, and control tracepoint/logging behavior.
:
:
:
: Targeting modes:
:
:
:
: * By location: provide `filePath` + `line`, and omit `breakpointId` (or pass `null`). Do not use placeholder strings such as `""`, `"/"`, or `"__omit__"`.
:
: * By ID: provide an existing opaque canonical `breakpointId` returned by `[xdebug_set_breakpoint](#xdebug_set_breakpoint)` or `[xdebug_list_breakpoints](#xdebug_list_breakpoints)` (optional `filePath`/`line` can relocate line breakpoints).
:
:
:
: Validation:
:
:
:
: * In location mode, both `filePath` and `line` are required.
:
: * In ID mode, breakpoint must exist and be uniquely identified by `breakpointId`.
:
: * In location mode, `filePath` is relative to the project root, `line` is 1-based, and the target location must be executable.
:
:
:
: Event reporting:
:
:
:
: * Invalid `condition` expressions are reported asynchronously via `xdebug_control_session(...).breakpointErrorsTail`.
:
: * Tracepoint output from breakpoints with `isLogMessage` and/or `isLogStack` is drained via `xdebug_control_session(action=DRAIN_EVENTS).tracepointOutputsTail`.
:
: * Breakpoint-error and tracepoint-output reporting are currently supported only by JVM-based debuggers (Java, Kotlin, etc.).
:
: * A successful `[xdebug_set_breakpoint](#xdebug_set_breakpoint)` response does not guarantee that `condition` or tracepoint expressions are valid; check later `breakpointErrorsTail` before relying on them.
:
: * Successful line-breakpoint responses also include `lineText`, a truncated excerpt of the actual source line where the breakpoint now resides. Inspect it to confirm placement before resuming.
:
:
:
: Apply semantics:
:
:
:
: * Provided fields are applied as the resulting state for the target breakpoint.
:
: * `condition=null` clears existing condition.
:
: * `isLogMessage=true` logs breakpoint hit position.
:
: * `isLogStack=true` logs current stack trace.
:
: * If both flags are true, both position and stack are logged.
:
: * With `isLogMessage`/`isLogStack` + `suspendPolicy=NONE`, the breakpoint behaves as a tracepoint.
:
: * In ID mode, if `filePath`/`line` are provided for a line breakpoint, it is relocated (recreated) at the new location.
:
: * In ID mode, for non-line breakpoints, `filePath`/`line` are ignored and reported in `message`.
:
: * Any successful operation marks breakpoint as `agent` ownership (`mcpBreakpointMarker`).
:
:
:
: Next call:
:
:
:
: * Use returned `lineText` and/or `[xdebug_list_breakpoints](#xdebug_list_breakpoints)` to verify placement.
:
: * Start/continue execution via `xdebug_start_debugger_session` or `xdebug_control_session(action=RESUME)`.
:
:
:
: Parameters:

:
:
: * `breakpointId`: Canonical breakpoint ID returned by `[xdebug_set_breakpoint](#xdebug_set_breakpoint)` or `[xdebug_list_breakpoints](#xdebug_list_breakpoints)`.
:
: * `filePath`: Optional file path to filter breakpoints. Path to the file. Supports project-relative paths, paths with `..`, absolute paths, archive entries like `/path/lib.jar!/pkg/Foo.class`, and URLs such as `file://`, `jar://`, and `jrt://`. Any path returned from the other tools can be passed as is (e.g. paths from `search_*` tools). If not specified, returns all breakpoints. Default: null.
:
: * `line`: 1-based line number. Required only in location mode. Optional in ID mode to relocate line breakpoints.
:
: * `condition`: Optional condition expression - breakpoint will only trigger when this evaluates to true. Validation errors are reported asynchronously via `xdebug_control_session(...).breakpointErrorsTail` (JVM-based debuggers only). Default: null.
:
: * `isLogMessage`: Whether to log breakpoint hit position (source location) when breakpoint is reached. In JVM-based debuggers output is available via `xdebug_control_session(action=DRAIN_EVENTS).tracepointOutputsTail`. Default: false.
:
: * `isLogStack`: Whether to log stack trace when breakpoint is reached. In JVM-based debuggers output is available via `xdebug_control_session(action=DRAIN_EVENTS).tracepointOutputsTail`. Default: false.
:
: * `temporary`: Temporary breakpoint (removed after first hit). Default: false.
:
: * `suspendPolicy`: Suspend policy: ALL, THREAD, NONE. Default: ALL.
:
: * `enabled`: Whether breakpoint is enabled. Default: true.
:
: * `projectPath`: The project path. Always provide this value if known to reduce ambiguous calls. If only the current working directory is known, you can use it as the project path.

:
: * `path` should come from the current paused `[xdebug_get_frame_values](#xdebug_get_frame_values)` / `[xdebug_get_value_by_path](#xdebug_get_value_by_path)` output.
:
:
:
: Path format is the same as in `[xdebug_get_value_by_path](#xdebug_get_value_by_path)`. `newValue` must be a raw expression in the language of the current frame, and it must be assignable to the target value by the debugger/evaluator. Do not pass JSON-escaped payloads or literal escape sequences such as `\\"text\\"`.
:
:
:
: Result:
:
:
:
: * Returns `oldValue`/`newValue`/`applied`.
:
: * Unsupported mutation returns an error with a textual message.
:
:
:
: Next call:
:
:
:
: * Re-read value via `[xdebug_get_value_by_path](#xdebug_get_value_by_path)` or `[xdebug_get_frame_values](#xdebug_get_frame_values)` to confirm.

:
:
: * `sessionId`: Debug session ID. Use the current ID returned by `[xdebug_get_debugger_status](#xdebug_get_debugger_status)` or `[xdebug_start_debugger_session](#xdebug_start_debugger_session)`. If a session has stopped, timed out, or disappeared, refresh the session list before reusing an old ID. Format: uses session name as ID by default; if multiple sessions share the same name, ID is `<sessionName>#<executionId>`. If null and exactly one active session exists, it is selected automatically. If multiple sessions are active and `sessionId` is omitted, the call fails. Default: null.
:
: * `frameIndex`: Stack frame index as integer (0 = top frame). Obtain this from the current paused `[xdebug_get_stack](#xdebug_get_stack)` result; do not reuse a cached frame index after RESUME, STEP_*, `xdebug_run_to_line`, or any change in paused location. If null, uses the top frame. Default: null.
:
: * `path`: Path to target value, same format as `[xdebug_get_value_by_path](#xdebug_get_value_by_path)`. Use exact node names from the current paused `[xdebug_get_frame_values](#xdebug_get_frame_values)` / `[xdebug_get_value_by_path](#xdebug_get_value_by_path)` output and refresh stale path tokens after the paused location changes.
:
: * `newValue`: New value expression to assign. Pass raw expression text in the language of the current frame; it must be assignable to the target value by the debugger/evaluator. Do not pass JSON-escaped payloads or literal backslash-escaped quoted text.
:
: * `projectPath`: The project path. Always provide this value if known to reduce ambiguous calls. If only the current working directory is known, you can use it as the project path.

xdebug_start_debugger_session
: Start a debugger session for either an existing run configuration by name or a code location (`filePath` + `line`) in the current project. Use this tool to start a debugger session. Use this tool with either an existing run configuration name, or with `filePath` + `line`. When using `filePath` + `line`, a line with a runnable method such as `main`, a test, or another executable entry point will almost always work. If you are unsure which line to use, `[get_run_configurations](#get_run_configurations)` can help discover runnable locations in the file. The session will be started, and you can then use other debugger tools to control execution.
:
:
:
: Preconditions:
:
:
:
: * When using `configurationName`, pass the exact existing run configuration name; do not pass a test method name or other derived target identifier.
:
: * When using `filePath` + `line`, point at a runnable code location such as `main`, a test, or another executable entry point.
:
: * Set at least one breakpoint first; otherwise the program may run to completion without pausing.
:
: * Pass either `configurationName`, or `filePath` together with `line`. These modes are mutually exclusive.
:
:
:
: Behavior:
:
:
:
: * Waits for session creation up to `timeout`.
:
: * Applies a grace wait (`graceWaitMs`) after the session starts and returns refreshed state.
:
: * Optional launch overrides (`programArguments`, `workingDirectory`, `envs`) are applied only for this debug launch and are not persisted.
:
: * `[get_run_configurations](#get_run_configurations)` is the source of truth for override support: only pass launch overrides when the selected run configuration reports `supportsDynamicLaunchOverrides=true`.
:
: * Do not pass these override parameters unless you explicitly need to change the configured launch values for this debug launch.
:
: * Missing/null override parameters keep existing run configuration values unchanged.
:
: * For string overrides (`programArguments`, `workingDirectory`), missing/null or empty string (`""`) keeps the existing value unchanged.
:
: * Pass a whitespace-only string such as `" "` to clear an existing value for this debug launch.
:
:
:
: Next call:
:
:
:
: * `xdebug_control_session(action=WAIT_FOR_PAUSE)` to wait for first suspension.
:
: * After pause, call `[xdebug_get_stack](#xdebug_get_stack)` and `[xdebug_get_frame_values](#xdebug_get_frame_values)` (or `[xdebug_evaluate_expression](#xdebug_evaluate_expression)`) for runtime evidence.
:
:
:
: Returns a flat result with debugger session metadata plus the execution snapshot fields from the launch:
:
:
:
: * `sessionId`, `name`, `status`, and optional `runConfigurationName`
:
: * `output` preview and optional `fullOutputPath`
:
: * optional `exitCode` when process termination is already known
:
:
:
: Parameters:
:
:
:
: * `configurationName`: Name of the existing run configuration to debug.

### Execution tools

execute_run_configuration
: Run either an existing run configuration by name or a temporary run configuration created from a code location (`filePath` + `line`) in the current project, then wait up to the specified timeout for it to finish. Use this tool with either a configuration name returned by `[get_run_configurations](#get_run_configurations)`, or with a run point (`filePath` + `line`) returned by `get_run_configurations(filePath = ...)`.
:
:
:
: Optional launch overrides (`programArguments`, `workingDirectory`, `envs`) are applied only for this run and are not persisted. Do not pass these override parameters unless you explicitly need to change the configured launch values for this run. Missing/null override parameters keep existing run configuration values unchanged. For string overrides (`programArguments`, `workingDirectory`), missing/null or empty string (`""`) keeps the existing value unchanged. Pass a whitespace-only string such as `" "` to clear an existing value for this launch.
:
:
:
: Pass either `configurationName`, or `filePath` together with `line`. These modes are mutually exclusive.
:
:
:
: Behavior:
:
:
:
: * When `waitForExit=true`, waits up to `timeout` milliseconds for process termination. If the timeout expires, the process keeps running in the background and `exitCode` is omitted from the result.
:
: * When `waitForExit=false`, waits only for the process to start, then returns immediately without applying `timeout`.
:
: * `fullOutputPath` points to a temp file with the full raw output and may continue growing while the process is alive.
:
:
:
: Returns the execution result including current output snapshot, optional exit code, and optional `fullOutputPath`.
:
:
:
: Parameters:
:
:
:
: * `configurationName`: Name of the existing run configuration to execute.
:
: * `filePath`: File path relative to the project root. Provide together with `line` to create and execute a temporary run configuration from code context.
:
: * `line`: 1-based line number for `filePath`. Provide together with `filePath` and do not combine with `configurationName`.
:
: * `timeout`: Timeout in milliseconds.
:
: * `waitForExit`: Whether to wait for process termination. If false, the tool returns immediately after the process starts and ignores `timeout`.
:
: * `programArguments`: Optional program arguments override for this launch only. Missing/null or empty string keeps the existing value; whitespace-only string clears it.
:
: * `workingDirectory`: Optional working directory override for this launch only. Missing/null or empty string keeps the existing value; whitespace-only string clears it.
:
: * `envs`: Optional environment variable overrides for this launch only. Missing/null keeps existing env unchanged; when provided, values are merged over existing env.
:
: * `projectPath`: The project path. Always provide this value if known to reduce ambiguous calls. If only the current working directory is known, you can use it as the project path.

get_run_configurations
: Returns either project run configurations or executable code locations, depending on the input.
:
:
:
: Without `filePath`, this tool lists the project's existing run configurations. The result includes configuration names and, when available, launch details such as program arguments, working directory, environment variables, and `supportsDynamicLaunchOverrides`.
:
:
:
: `supportsDynamicLaunchOverrides` is the source-of-truth capability flag for one-time launch overrides (`programArguments`, `workingDirectory`, `envs`) in `[execute_run_configuration](#execute_run_configuration)` and `[xdebug_start_debugger_session](#xdebug_start_debugger_session)`. Only pass those override parameters when this flag is `true` for the selected configuration.
:
:
:
: With `filePath`, this tool discovers executable entry points (run points) in that file, such as test methods, main methods, or other executable entry points where the IDE shows a Run gutter icon. The result contains `filePath` and `runPoints`; use the returned line numbers with `[execute_run_configuration](#execute_run_configuration)` to run from code.
:
:
:
: Parameters:
:
:
:
: * `filePath`: Optional file path relative to the project root. When provided, returns run points (executable entry points) in the file instead of project-wide run configurations.
:
: * `projectPath`: The project path. Always provide this value if known to reduce ambiguous calls. If only the current working directory is known, you can use it as the project path.
